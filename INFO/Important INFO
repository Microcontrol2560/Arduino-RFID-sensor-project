RC522
The MFRC522 is a highly integrated reader/writer for contactless communication at 13.56 MHz. The MFRC522 reader supports ISO 14443A / MIFARE® mode.
The MFRC522’s internal transmitter part is able to drive a reader/writer antenna designed to communicate with ISO/IEC 14443A/MIFARE® cards and transponders 
without additional active circuitry. The receiver part provides a robust and efficient implementation of a demodulation and decoding circuitry for signals from 
ISO/IEC 14443A/MIFARE® compatible cards and transponders. The digital part handles the complete ISO/IEC 14443A framing and error detection (Parity & CRC).The MFRC522 
supports MIFARE®Classic (e.g. MIFARE® Standard) products. The MFRC522 supports contactless communication using MIFARE® higher transfer speeds up to 848 kbit/s in both directions.
Various host interfaces are implemented:
• SPI interface
• Serial UART (similar to RS232 with voltage levels according pad voltage supply)
• I2C interface.
